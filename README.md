## ‚ú® Core Features
**-Flexible Input Methods:** Provide your resume and job description by uploading a .pdf/.docx file or by pasting the raw text directly.

**-Intelligent Skill Extraction:** The analyzer parses the resume to extract skills only from dedicated sections (like "Skills," "Technical Skills"), avoiding inaccurate matches from general text.

**-Interactive Skill Confirmation:** Users can review the extracted skills in a checkbox grid and deselect any that aren't relevant before the final analysis.

**-Multi-Layered Scoring:** The application calculates three distinct match scores:

  **1. vs. Job Description:** A direct comparison of your skills against the specific job ad.

  **2. vs. Job Field:** A comparison against the standard, expected skills for a selected career path (e.g., "Software Engineer," "Data Analyst").

  **3. Best Career Match:** An analysis of your skills against all defined job fields to recommend the career path you are most qualified for.

## Detailed & Actionable Feedback:

- Identifies "critical" missing skills by analyzing their frequency in the job description.

- Provides multi-point, dynamic feedback on how to improve your alignment.

- Offers suggestions for online courses to fill specific skill gaps.

- Includes general resume improvement tips, like quantifying achievements and using action verbs.
